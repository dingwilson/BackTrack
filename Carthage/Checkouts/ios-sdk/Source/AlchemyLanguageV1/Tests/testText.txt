Romancing SaGa 2 is out on iOS and Android May 26, according to the game's official website. The enhanced mobile port of the Super Famicom game marks the first time the game is available in English.

Square Enix announced that the Romancing SaGa 2 remake was heading stateside in April. Alongside the English translation are revamped visuals, new classes, a gardening mini-game and a New Game Plus feature.

The role-playing game will cost $17.99 at launch. Japanese fans received the mobile port back in March, alongside a Vita release. Gamers stateside will have to make do with the version for smartphones for now.
